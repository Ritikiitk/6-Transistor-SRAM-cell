# 6-Transistor SRAM cell
A 6T SRAM cell contains two cross-coupled CMOS inverters and two NMOS access transistors. 
The inverters' output (input) forms the internal nodes of cells A and B. 
Once active, access transistors allow the cell's internal nodes to communicate with the cell's input/output ports. 
The input/output ports of the cell unit of measurement are termed bit lines (BL and ~BL)
