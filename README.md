# 6-Transistor SRAM cell
A 6T SRAM cell contains two cross-coupled CMOS inverters and two NMOS access transistors. 
Once active, access transistors allow the cell's internal nodes to communicate with the cell's input/output ports. 
The input/output ports of the cell unit of measurement are termed bit lines (BL and ~BL).
The flip-flop is mostly used for alternate 
storage. As long as the other value is pushed to it, one flip-flop will 
preserve the value.

LTspice contains an integrated schematic editor, waveform viewer and advanced features. It is easy to use once you learn some basic commands.
The book (CMOS SRAM Circuit Design and Parametric Test in Nano-Scaled Technologies by Manoj Sachdeva) is my first choice, and I use LT-Spice to create the schematic diagram for a 6T SRAM cell.
